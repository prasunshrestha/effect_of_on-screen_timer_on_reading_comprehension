# The Effect of On-screen Timer on Reading Comprehension: A/B Testing
A randomized controlled trial to understand the effect of a visible on-screen timer on reading compression.

In this paper, we are interested in understanding the effect of having a visible timer on reading compression in the context of timed assessments. Our experiment is designed to test if there is a causal relationship between the presence of a visible timer on the screen and student performance on a digital assessment task. Conflicting anecdotal references such as students feeling a sense of control or the opposite — being distracted or hurried by the timer — have motivated us to set up a randomized experiment to uncover the true relationship between an on-screen timer and student performance.

Here were our biggest takeaways in brief from our project:

1. Much to our surprise, there was no statistically significant difference in the reading comprehension score between the treatment group (participants who received the timer while reading the passage) and the control group (participants who did not receive the timer).
2. The survey completion rate increased by 3.91 percentage points in the treatment group, and the increase was statistically significant at the 5% level.
3. The treatment group (surprisingly) also spent ~42 seconds more on answering the questions, with the difference being statistically significant at the 5% level.
